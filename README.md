### Problem Statement
I’d like to make an app that helps you plan your garden. The app would allow you input what you’d like to grow, 
and it will generate a timeline for you. Depending on the plant and where you live impact when you should
start growing seeds and when you can transplant the plant outside. I’d like the application to generate an 
estimated day of the year you should plant the seed, when you can move it outside, and the expected time until
yield. It might also be nice for it to generate a care report for the plant, including instructions on how to care
for it as a seedling and once it’s planted outside.
